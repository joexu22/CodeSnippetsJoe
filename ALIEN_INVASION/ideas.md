# Some Personal Ideas Surrounding Alien Invasion
* Long Term Goals
* I can create the game
* Hook things up with Machine Learning Code
* Have an AI go and beat the game I create myself

# Honestly it would be simple to just publish the game
* Having an Machine Learning AI do it would be pretty cool though
* Learn how to deploy this through Docker

# Visual Goals
* Multi-Elemental Based Bullets
