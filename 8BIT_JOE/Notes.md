# A Quick Pygame Implementation
At a crossroads at how to solve the character facing direction problem

There are 4 states the character can be in...
In each of the 4 states there are 4 inputs that can be assesed

16 brances worth of code
Do I implement 16 branches worth of turning code

Just to see my chracter turn around
Not really even sure how it would look...

Need to code my own data structure
Its a complete graph with 4 nodes and 3 actions on each node that takes it to another node
