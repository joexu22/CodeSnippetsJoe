# Various Code Snippets
So, after a 5 whole years of studying computer science, I finally commit to this idea that a good programmer doesn't code things twice...  
So this repo will likely store some of the more interesting code stuff I pick up along the way...  
I feel so sad about all my lost work though :( ...  
I should hoard stuff better...

# Personal Account/Philosophy of my Own Code
It's a philosophical question to me whether or not I should value my own code...
Obviously, starting out, every single piece of code I was writing was a hackjob, but personally that work was wrought with blood, sweet, and tears. Overdramatic, but CS is really though at times. The delimma is that programming and trying to do it right was a real struggle and I'm quite proud of the accomplishments I have made over the course of the last five years. If we are to really treasure every moment of our lives, then those starting attempts at CS, the first steps of my future career/life, then I should really attempt to capture those moments. However, in capturing those moments, I am spending time reflecting and recalling as I write. And so we come to the understanding of modern paralysis... the inability to do anything out of fear of losing the past.  
Curiously, this brings me to the thought of the importance of celebration. I guess I finally realize the historical reasoning of why people party... It really is to celebrate the accomplishments/past moments in history... Immortalize the accomplishments of the past and prepare the next steps of the future...  It's so simple but it takes me 23 years to figure simple things out...
