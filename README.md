# Various Code Snippets
I've been coding for around 5 years now...
I suppose that this kinda makes me a "Senior Engineer" - (Don't quite have the experience on paper)

My ultimate goal as a Computer Programmer is to not code things multiple times...
The *Purpose* of this repo is to store some of the more interesting code I have come to pick up along the way
	Being somewhat of a personal "Code Cookbook"
	Basically my programming notes throughout my career

I do feel sad about all of my previous lost work though :( ...
That being said, I would like to avoid my hoarding tendencies

# My Own Code
I often wonder whether or not I should value my own code...
Starting out when I was a younger/novice, but infinately more hopeful coder, everything I wrote was much of a hackjob.
Still much of the work was wrought with blood, sweet, and tears...
This notion is quite overdramatic, but CS can get somewhat mentally challenging at times.

There's quite a camp for every which way and that type of programming, and getting something down was a struggle.
However, I'm now quite proud of my own personal accomplishments, and I at least of have a good starting point

# Personal Account/Philosophy on Valuing Time
If we are to really treasure every moment of our lives... then we would look somewhat like fools.
However, I am constantly reminded of my first steps into the world of CS.
Linux and Bash... quite intimadating, surely different from Windows/Mac

Those steps surely where the first steps towards my future career/life
I've made somewhat of a poor attempt at documenting those moments...

Yet, I should capture those moments.
The catch and paradox, one valuing the present moment is that one starts to see the tree before the forest.
Rather, one only saw the passing roadsign but missed the scenery. 

I suspect that this is some sort of Modern Paralysis... the inability to do anything out of fear of losing the past.  

# The Role of Celebration
Curiously, Paralysis brings me to the role and importance of human celebration.
Finding a historcal reasoning in why people party/celebrate.

Paying respect and honoring our accomplishments/moments of history allows us to wrap these things to completion
Having wrapped something to completion we start to prepare for the future.
