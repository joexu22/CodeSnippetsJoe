# Various Code Snippets

Keeping various code snippets here
It's been 7 years now... since I first started coding things worth remembering...
Still on the path to become a Senior Engineer (taking my time)

- Being somewhat of a personal "Code Cookbook"
- Basically my programming notes throughout my career

Tasks
TODO: Collecting Old Code
TODO: Avoid Hoarding/Prune The Code

## My Own Code

What is the value of the code I write?

- Much of my work is derivative - they are mainly problem sets that many others have already solved (I would think that there are more elegant solutions elsewhere)
- This repo mainly serves myself as a memory tool...
- A possible potential for this repo, is that I start writing libraries with easily quickly accessible APIs.

I must acknowledge my work as a younger programmer, but infinitely more hopeful novice, was very much a compilation of hacks - very much so a hackjob.

- I still have a feeling that much of the work was wrought with an investment of blood, sweet, and tears...
- Overdramatized (for sure), but I do think that CS can get somewhat mentally challenging.

I hope that this codebase is a good starting point for future work down the road.

## Personal Account/Philosophy on Valuing Time

The motivation for this project is to save time - also to save the amount of information that I keep inside my own head.

- I imagine that my memory and ability will dull over time - hopefully this becomes a buffer
- I want to treasure the time I have already invested into code

I acknowledge that if I were to really treasure every moment of my life, I would act awfully like a fool...
Yet, I recall the first forays I took into the world of CS - the memories are quite vivid.
Understanding Linux and Bash was quite intimidating... it was really different from Windows/Mac. I have since adapted. Those first steps (the code I was writing back then) surely informs my career/life. I will have to say that I made a poor attempt at documenting the work I did.

So this repo, is an attempt at capturing my work as a programmer.
The catch and paradox of this approach: By valuing the present moment, I may start seeing the tree before noticing the forest. Rather, I fear I will pay attention to only the road-signs rather than the scenery.

## The Role of Celebration

I remember my initial hesitancy towards "coding"... there was so much to learn and so many approaches to take that it was quite overwhelming. I thought that getting started with always a struggle. I consider myself have suffered from a form of paralysis.

I tend to suffer from paralysis - A major issues: not knowing the best way to approach code.
Analyzing this on some levels, I believe that the best way to approach paralysis is "celebration"...

- On an abstract level this idea connects to historical reasons as to why people party/celebrate.
- I am personally able to wrap up (to completion) my previous work by celebrating my accomplishments.
- This act opens up the way for future endeavors.
