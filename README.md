# Various Code Snippets
So, after a 5 whole years of studying computer science, I finally commit to this idea that a good programmer doesn't code things twice...  
So repo will likely store some of the more interesting code stuff I pick up along the way...  
I feel so sad about all my lost work though :( ... I should hoard stuff better...
